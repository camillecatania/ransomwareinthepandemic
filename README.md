# Ransomware in the pandemic
Welcome to the GitHub page of my postgraduate project about ransomware in the pandemic

### Introduction

Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2019, life and work as we know it have changed. To adapt to the new sanitary measures, a new business model consisting of working from home (WFH) has been put into place to ensure the continuity of work during lockdowns and preventing the virus from further spreading. To do so, individuals started using their personal devices outside of offices firewalls which led to security issues. As reported by The Guardian in 2021, remote working has permitted the increase of cyber-attacks, and in particular ransomware, with employees working outside of offices networks (Paul, 2021). Ransomware can be defined as a type of malware used by cybercriminals to infect computers and networks to encrypt data. To retrieve the data, victims must pay a ransom set by the attacker. An increase in the amounts requested by attackers and paid by victims has been noted since 2019 (Paul, 2021), especially in the US.

Additionally, many pandemics related scams have emerged such as fake vaccination schemes, lures about masks, and impersonations to offer free governmental help. Individuals also became victims of ransomware in their personal usage (Weisbaum, 2021) by clicking on unknown links, opening attachments, or visiting unsecured websites. As people were prone to heightened levels of stress and unpreparedness when facing this new ‘normality’, attackers were provided with more opportunities to be successful by targeting their vulnerabilities (Lalli et al., 2021). Similarly, this situation led to higher rates of unemployment, pushing people to resort to cyber-crime to support themselves (Lalli et al., 2021). No matter how prepared companies might be against ransomware attacks, everyone can become a victim. However, for the purposes of its research, this paper will solely focus on the ransomware attacks conducted on companies and organisations throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Approach 
An Excel dataset was created for the purposes on this project on which all atacks found were listed. The attacks ranged from 2020 to 2021 and occured in member states of the European Union, as well as the UK and Switzerland, and the US. 

### Graphical representation
To represent the data that was colected in the dataset previously mentioned, D3.js was used. D3.js is a JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data. Examples of graphical representation could be found on the website of the library and githubs of different members of the D3 community. The code used for the creation of the graphs used in this paper can be found on this Github repository.
